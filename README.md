## Description
A Client requested an application which will provide their buyers the flexibility to create a purchase requisition for indirect goods and services like marketing, media and advertising services or travel, entertainment, or facilities services and turning that request into a purchase order. With more and more of their suppliers requesting cash on delivery, our client is researching ways of streamlining their process of making indirect purchases while maintaining some efficiencies and accountability in their accounts payable process.

## Project Planning
GitHub Projects was instrumental in keeping on track and focused on the many task to complete and/or rethink. A task/todos was created for needed starting with obtaining/creating the user stories and detailing those requirements out on paper and generating an ERD diagram.  From there the project was created, then the database and models/tables.  Building the correct relationships between the tables was keen in creating the needed endpoints.  After completing each task, I moved them from 'In Progress' to 'Complete' with GitHub Projects which kept me moving forward without needing to consider what task/step was up next.  After all the endpoints was working as designed to meet requirements, security, JWT and user features were added ensuring private endpoints where private and only the two public endpoints where public. After adding the user to each endpoint ensuring they meet each requirement as designed, I moved onto documentation.  Ensuring all objects were documented and needed elements/sections were covered in the README brought the project a completion.

## Usage

Using an API platform like Postman, as a registered user, you can access all operational endpoints of the Family Time Beverage API (FTBA) which are available on port 9092.  PostgresSQL is the database used and a new 'Database' entry, named beverages, needs to be created.  PGAdmin is a web-based GUI which can be used for this task as it can communicate with your Postgres database.

![FTBAPI ERD](./src/main/resources/assets/FTBAPI_ERD.png)

An unregistered user can only access the register endpoint as follows:
### #2 To Create a New User (Register):
```
localhost:9092/auth/users/register/

{
    "userName" : "jane",
    "email": "jane@aol.com",
    "password": "jane"
}
```
A registered user can accessc the login endpoint as follows:
### #3 To Login As a Registered User:
```
localhost:9092/auth/users/login/

{
    "email":"jane@aol.com",
    "password":"jane"
}
```

Once the registered user logs in, a JWT will be returned which will be needed to access all the other endpoints.  The JWT will need to be added to every request/endpoint headers section with 'Authorization' as a Key and the Value will need to be Bear [JWT] as follows:
